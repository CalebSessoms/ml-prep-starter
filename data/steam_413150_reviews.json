I think I've put in as many hours onto this game as I have Skyrim and Fallout.\n\nA game that lets you unwind without having to put a lot of thought into something - it's great after a hard day at work.\n\nMy husband also has this game. We've each played our own games solo and played on co-op. The choices you get at the beginning can be a bit confusing if someone hasn't played the game once through already, so it is suggested to do a Farm style when you start your first run through. If you pick one of the other start ups like the River, it will give you limited space on your farm to do any ranching or farming, and you really do need to farm in the beginning to be able to get money rolling in and to complete any of the quests.\n\nThis game has fishing, mining, adventure, combat, wine-making, making jams, collecting, felling (wood chopping), and so much more. You can choose to have romance or not. Have children or not. Upgrade your house, add buildings, remove buildings. It's all super simple with just enough intricacy to have a chuckle.\n\nI highly recommend this game. It is one of the games that has me considering buying a Steam Deck so I can play on the go. However, this game is better on a larger screen so you can see more of your farm at once.\n\nIf you are on the fence, I recommend watching some players actively playing this game to get a feel for it.",

Whether you're tending your crops, exploring the mines, building relationships, or just watching the seasons change—every moment is packed with charm and heart.\r\n\r\nWhat begins as a simple farming simulator unfolds into a deep, rewarding experience filled with secrets, stories, and choices that actually matter. The game respects your time, offers genuine freedom, and never pressures you into playing a certain way.\r\n\r\nThe pixel art is gorgeous, the music is calming and nostalgic, and the level of polish (especially from a solo dev!) is nothing short of incredible. And the updates? Constantly generous, adding tons of new content for free.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for something cozy, relaxing, and endlessly replayable, Stardew Valley is an absolute must-play. It’s not just a game—it’s an experience.",

Я, вооружившись мотыгой, что сияет не хуже копья рыцарского, и лейкой, достойной благочестивого паладина, вступил в бой не с ветряными мельницами, но с упрямыми сорняками и каменьями, кои восстают против всякого моего труда. И что сказать, о милостивые дамы и господа! Когда солнце склоняется к закату, и усталость гнездится в костях моих, я не отдыхаю, но сражаюсь с чудищами шахт, чьи глаза сверкают в темноте, как адские угли. А соседи мои, крестьяне и лавочники, — суть народ странный и неблагодарный: даруешь им ты цветок — они радуются, даруешь им камень — гневаются, будто не знают истинного величия рыцарской щедрости. И всё же, клянусь честью, я не отступлю, ибо в сей долине обрёл я цель великую — возродить землю, превратить её в райские угодья и снискать любовь прекрасной девы, даже если для того придётся мне тысячу раз полоть грядки и носить яйца куриные, словно трофеи битв великих!",

You are an office worker on a crowded city, burned out for the stress and pressure of your job, and after the death of your grandparent, you receive a letter where it tells you that you inherited his farm in Pelican Town, so without further delay you jump up into the adventure of making your own farm, far away from the noise.\n\n「 Here is where you adventure begins 」\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3579270920\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3579270920[/url]\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ✧ Positive aspects ⇁[/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhen I think in Stardew as a game, It reminds me to home, a place to come back when the noise of the world caps your dreams, a place to relax yourself and relieve from the stress. That's what is for me. If I want to recall about what this make this game so [i]unique[/i], to be a precedent and a stamp of quality is the balance between cozyness and the amount of challenging task you are \"forced\" to do to achieve the end of the game, that thin line of thoughtness not punisheable at all and the type of rewards make it exciting, because it rewards your effort, and your progress is not lost, maybe just a little delayed. \n\n\n➢ [i]Trermendous quantity of content [/i]and task to do. You can easily spend two or three years on the game playing no-stop from the dawn to dusk, that even if it could be a little overwhelming it's easily to dose and focus on few task before moving to the next ones, some task you won't start doing it until you reach the second, or the third year. \n\n\n➢ Good variety in terms of [i]recipes, animals, fishes and plants[/i]. I think it lacks a little in farm animals, but overall it gives you a good amount of content, that it changes with every season.\n\n\n➢ [i]Events and task all over the plac[/i]e. You have between two to three seasonal events, themed for each season, more you unlock you discover new ones that drops, then small events popping up here and there, secret passages, guild tasks, villager tasks, community center goals, fishing contests... and so one. \n\n➢ [i]Picturesque [/i]soundtrack. A good and characteristic melodies that you can easily attach them to it, a good point to differ it from other games on the same genre.\n\n➢ NPC romances and relationships. Any NPC on the village has his own story, his own rewards, and his own tasks. There are specific villagers that are 'singles', the ones you can marry and have kids, and others that you can earn a friendship, make their own specific tasks and get some rewards in advance.\n\nMost of those points that I summarized are just the surface of the game, it has many other details (like the skill system, tool improvement, fishing accessories, combat). I don't think separatedly are enough big to go much further explaining them, but it's what it highlights in the game.\n\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎✧ Negative aspects ⇁[/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\nAs much as I love this game, nothing is perfect, and it has some flaws that it mostly remains to the details, and I think it there are more additions or changes it will enhance the experience, but I'm not as sure if CorcernedApe will be willing to it, since of course his vision of his creation depends totally on him, and those are details, not the core of the game.\n\n\n➢ Early game a bit rough,and not friendly for new players, you feel the days are not enough an the stamine too short, I think the difficulty curvature is a bit high in the first years. However, it switchs some quite fast, because once you reach year two it start to became way easyer, mostly because you have way more resources and better tools/skills to manage the daily farm.\n\n➢ Even if the game has a good amount of decorating items, It kinda surprised me it doesn't have a single bathroom ones or more kitchen related, and it lacks in some more small ones, there are tons of plants, but hardly for other stuff, or some interactions between decorative items that could have been added or integrated better.\n\n➢ Don't be able to save in the middle of a game, just only going to bed, and even if a day in the game is short, could be a bit messy if you need to leave and you can't pause the game. \n\n➢ Even if I like the pixelart, I think some of them could be better, like the animalls, and the 'humans' in general (including you), they are big off compared to the overall scenario, and I think they need a modernized update, better shape, better texture, a bitter more of detail. But I think we all got used too much to it that a change would be weird, but I think is needed.\n\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2] ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎🏆Achievement hunting ⇁[/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\nFor how the game it is, and the amount of content it has, there is not really an [i]ultimate 100% guide[/i] for this game, most of the info you gather it mostly from the wiki and checking what you need to get an achievement, since most of the guides I checked were not totally completed at all, or there were missing some context and poper explanation. \n\n⋄ This is probably the most important one: \n\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3387177941\n\n⋄ Farm money it's a crucial aspect, and kegs are very important, this guide might help:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3419706564 \n\n\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎▫ ◨ ▪ FINAL THOUGHTS ▪ ◧ ▫[/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\nI personally enjoy this game a lot, even with the few issues and flaws it has, I think there are great alternatives nowadays in the market (Story of Seasons, Fields of Mistria, 'My Time At' games, Sun Heaven, Coral Island...), in case this one doesn't totally fits with you, for me it was a change when I played it first, it was something the cozy market needed, it was fresh, unique, it was literally competing with Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon, at least on PC literally destroyed them in terms of sales during those early years, it was the one leading. The game matured some quite good, you can feel it has some mechanics that feels a little old for the cozy game modern market, but nothing to really bother that much.\n\n\nAnd, in case I didn't say it enough times, it's now a classic game, a pilar in the farming/cozy market, what everyone compares when a new one release. It's hard to not put it high on the list, to not praise, and I think it deserve it. For what it offers, and it on sale, game is very cheap, I think no one really can't complain against it (even don't like it for personal taste), since game doesn't abuse at all with the price, and I mean, you have more than 100 hours of content without adding mods or just more stuff like decorating the farms and the house, or playing co-op with friends. The positive aspect it has to offer literally devours the negative ones. Is a game to recommend? Of course it is. The bad part is that you might not like it, that's the biggest issue, still worth a try.\n\n\n[table]\n               [tr]\n                             [th] ◈ Overall Score ◈ [/th]\n                             [th] /ᐠ - ˕ -マ [/th]\n               [/tr]\n              [tr]\n                             [td] 9,5/10[/td]\n                             [td] One of the best cozy games ever created[/td]                           \n              [/tr]\n[/table]",

It lets you play in the life of a farmer and eventually manage to get involved in the fluff stories of the citizens in the valley as well.\n\nThe game has basic events, relationships that can lead to marriage and even adventure! If you are a fan of the old Harvest Moon games, this game is definitely up your alley.\n\nSit back, relax and enjoy the game!",

This game is a comfort game for me, something I can turn on whenever I just want something to do. its a game that I know i'll always come back to whenever I can't decide what to play. and with the Pc version I can finally try out mods I couldnt on the switch.",

    "review": "[h1] Short Review [/h1]\nGameplay: 8/10\nVisuals: 9/10\nAudio/Sound Design: 10/10\nVoice Acting: N/A\nStory: 8/10\nOverall: 8.75/10\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n[b] 8/10 [/b]\nStardew Valley has easy to understand and smooth gameplay. The grinding in the game feels worth it, especially the first time around, and hardly becomes mundane. The quests are simple yet engaging, and the way you progress through the story and build your farm is both easygoing and rewarding. My only complaint? This game nearly requires guides to get through without frustration, and a lot of planning and dedication. The wiki will become your best friend, if mods aren't of your interest. The best part? There's no time limit or expected level of progress you need to make at any given time. So if you feel you're falling behind? Don't worry, you quite literally have infinite time to get to where you want to be. This game will never make you feel guilty or punished for simply taking your time and working at your own pace. (Also, the fishing is very much a \"you love it or you hate it\" situation. I personally hate it, but see how people enjoy it and the challenge it brings into the game.)\n\n[h1] Visuals [/h1]\n[b] 9/10 [/b]\nThe art style itself is very iconic on its own, and each character comes with unique and recognizable designs. I've quickly grown fond of the pixelized artstyle that has been used! I feared I wouldn't like it at first, but it becomes charming and easy to look at. My only complaint is that some of the vibrant colors are hard on the eyes, and I've already modded them out the first chance I could for something more muted. But that doesn't hurt the quality at all, and is simply a nitpick that I felt should be mentioned.\n\n[h1] Audio/Sound Design [/h1]\n[b] 10/10 [/b]\nThis is the only part of the game I feel is absolutely perfect. I regularly listen to both Frozen Pizza and Eggs (Shane's Theme) and Dance of the Moonlight Jellies to sleep every night. The upbeat music during the day and yet calming almost beautiful sounds played during nighttime events are all amazingly put together. I can see why they started doing live events with orchestrated versions of these songs! And, not to mention, many characters (I believe primarily the romance interests) get their own themes which feel so much like them and their stories. The music never gets old, and I rarely find myself at all annoyed by repeating songs. And even if I did, there's in-game items you can get to set any area to play your favorite song! I keep a jukebox on my farm to listen to Shane's Theme constantly. \n\n[h1] Voice Acting [/h1]\n[b] N/A [/b]\nNo voice acting, and the game itself doesn't require it, so it doesn't affect the game whatsoever.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n[b] 8/10 [/b]\nI love that each and every villager has their own lives, struggles, and backgrounds. It makes Pelican Town feel truly alive. Each of the romancable options obviously have further fleshed out stories than the rest, but do not be mistaken, it is very much worth it to raise hearts with everyone. No character has a bland or boring story, and each heart event reveals just that much more behind the lovable townsfolk you encounter. My complaints? Some of the dialogue is either hard to understand, misinterpreted, or simply doesn't make sense. (Spoilers ahead for Shane's story.)  [spoiler] After marrying Shane and going through his struggle with recovering from alcohol addiction, he frequently references drinking and having a hard time deciding between one alcohol beverage or another. Addiction is never a straight-forward process of recovery, but the way he so casually mentions alcohol isn't the words of someone trying to recover, but of someone actively in the throws of indulging within alcoholism. [/spoiler] Besides that, some lines are interpreted as rude by other characters, when you are simply giving a sane or honest reaction to the situation (Sam & Penny's heart events, I'm looking at you). I feel like a few minor changes in dialogue could make this game go a lot further, instead of leading to awkward, confusing, or perhaps even frustrating situations. \n\n[h1] Finishing Notes [/h1]\nThis game is beautiful, and I love it through and through. It is far from perfect, but for where it is it is as perfect as I would ever expect from anything in the world. This game means more to me than I could even describe, and it is a worthy venture to take if you're ever considering getting it. There's a reason it's so popular, and don't be afraid to join!",

I picked it up just to try and suddenly I was hours deep, completely hooked.\n\nIt’s relaxing without being boring. You can farm, fish, explore, or just enjoy the quiet rhythm of small town life. There’s no pressure, just constant little rewards and a world that feels warm and alive.\n\nIf you enjoy chill, meaningful games that let you go at your own pace, this one’s a gem.",
